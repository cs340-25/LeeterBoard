# LeetCode University Leaderboard - Development Sprints

## **Sprint 1 (2-3 Weeks)**  

### **Backend**  
Work on requesting the data from LeetCode, storing the data in a database, and finding ways to optimize this retrieval. Also, start using this stored data to make proper calculations and ensure we are able to connect this to the front end.  

### **Frontend**  
Set up the front end using React or basic HTML/CSS. The goal is to establish a foundational UI for displaying the leaderboard, ensuring a clean and expandable design. This sprint will focus on fleshing out the necessities to build upon in later stages.
